      <description>Introduction Before starting HackTheBox Offshore I needed some background on attacking Active Directory environment. I had had some sysadmin experience in AD and it was time to going through penetration testing course focused on Active Directory. I had already heard about PentesterAcademy training course (Attacking and Defending Active Directory) and didn&amp;rsquo;t spend time on searching much back then and immediately purchased this course which is accompanying training course for CRTP examination.</description>

      <description>Blog on my red teaming journey. My Main objective is learning complex topics through teaching others, that forces me to dig deep and don&amp;rsquo;t just execute &amp;ldquo;hackish&amp;rdquo; commands without understanding deeper meaning. Second objective is teaching others, because sharing knowledge strenghtens community and helps beginner folks to build up their cyber security career.
Blog posts will be about  Attacking and Secure Active Directory environment Explore common Web Application issues Red Team tradecraft Little bit of exploit development on windows or linux environment Explaining newly discovered 0days  Contact me  Email: ltakashvili[at]protonmail.</description>
